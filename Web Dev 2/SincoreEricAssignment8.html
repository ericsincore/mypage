					<h2>Location</h2>
					<p class= "line">Clarksville is located along the Cumberland River in Tennessee near the Kentucky border. It is approximately 30-45 minutes northwest of Nashville, TN. It's location makes it a sought after place to live for workers from Nashville due to the lower priced homes in Clarksville. It is located off of Interstate 24, with 4 exits entering into Clarksville directly.</p>

					<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
					<p>Being located in the south gives the town a easy going feeling and most people you meet will say 'sir / ma'am'. The size of the city is quite large and is home to about 150,000 people. That does lead to heavy traffic at nearly all times, especially near the heart of the shopping area. With the abundance of people there is a small population of homeless people lurking about the city, and crime does happen. Overall though, this feels like a safe town and in my opinion it is easy to forget just how big it is.</p>
