					<h2>Rentals</h2>
					<p class="line">Clarksville has a large quantity of rental properties available through out the city and the county limits. The ever expanding population of the city has increased construction throughout. It is common to see multi unit appartment complexes being built where woods once stood. With the large population of military members in the city people are routinely vacating properties. The increase in home prices and mortgage rates have made renting a more reasonable solution for some. You can find rental properties on common websites such as,<a class="body" href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank"> Zillow</a> as well as by contacting local realtors at <a class="body" href="https://www.jurneehometeam.com/" target="_blank">Jurnee Home Team</a>  </p>
