		<h2>Author</h2>
		<p>Eric Sincore was born in California in 1986, growing up around the country. He is a current employee of the United States Army. He has played golf at a variety of courses in America. He is an avid amateur golfer, rarely every breaking 100. His opinion on the game should be taken lightly as he has no real training in the game and routinely slices the ball.</p>
